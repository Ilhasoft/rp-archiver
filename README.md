Service for archiving old RapidPro/TextIt runs and messages. It interacts directly with the database 
and writes archive files to an S3 compatible endpoint.

## Deploying

As it is a Go application, it compiles to a binary and that binary along with the config file is all
you need to run it on your server. You can find bundles for each platform in the
[releases directory](https://github.com/nyaruka/rp-archiver/releases). You should only run a single
instance for a deployment.

## Configuration

The service uses a tiered configuration system, each option takes precendence over the ones above it:

 1. The configuration file
 2. Environment variables starting with `ARCHIVER_` 
 3. Command line parameters

We recommend running it with no changes to the configuration and no parameters, using only
environment variables to configure it. You can use `% rp-archiver --help` to see a list of the
environment variables and parameters and for more details on each option.

 * `ARCHIVER_DB`: URL describing how to connect to the database (default "postgres://temba:temba@localhost/temba?sslmode=disable")
 * `ARCHIVER_TEMP_DIR`: The directory that temporary archives will be written before upload (default "/tmp")
 * `ARCHIVER_DELETE`: Whether to delete messages and runs after they are archived, we recommend setting this to true for large installations (default false)

### AWS services:

 * `ARCHIVER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key id used to authenticate to AWS
 * `ARCHIVER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret access key used to authenticate to AWS
 * `ARCHIVER_AWS_REGION`: AWS region (ex: `eu-west-1`)
 
For writing of archives, Archiver needs access to a storage bucket on an S3 compatible service. For AWS we recommend that 
you choose SSE-S3 encryption as this is the only type that supports validation of upload ETags.

 * `ARCHIVER_S3_BUCKET`: name of your S3 bucket (ex: `dl-archiver-test"`)

If using a different encryption type or service that produces non-MD5 ETags:

 * `ARCHIVER_CHECK_S3_HASHES`: can be set to `FALSE` to disable checking of upload hashes.

### Logging and error reporting:

 * `ARCHIVER_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: used for metrics reporting
 * `ARCHIVER_SENTRY_DSN`: DSN to use when logging errors to Sentry
 * `ARCHIVER_LOG_LEVEL`: logging level to use (default is `info`)

## Development

Once you've checked out the code, you can build the service with:

```
go build github.com/nyaruka/rp-archiver/cmd/rp-archiver
```

This will create a new executable in $GOPATH/bin called `rp-archiver`.

To run the tests you need to create the test database:

```
$ createdb archiver_test
```

To run all of the tests:

```
go test -p=1 ./...
```
